    content: `Stepping onto the P. P. Savani University campus felt like entering a new world. The sheer scale of it was both daunting and exhilarating. I remember clutching my schedule like a lifeline, my eyes wide with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. The first few days were a blur of orientation sessions, ice-breakers, and getting hopelessly lost trying to find the School of Engineering building.\nWhat stood out the most, however, was the immediate sense of community. Seniors went out of their way to guide us fumbling freshers, and professors were surprisingly approachable. My first lecture in 'Introduction to Programming' wasn't just a dry-as-dust theoretical session; it was an interactive dialogue that sparked a genuine curiosity I didn't know I had. The week ended with the club fair, a vibrant explosion of energy and passion, where I signed up for the robotics club, already feeling like I was finding my place.`

    content: `In today's competitive world, a degree certificate is often just a ticket to the interview room. The real differentiator is practical experience, and there's no better way to gain it than through internships. While our curriculum provides a strong theoretical foundation, it's in a real-world work environment that you learn to apply that knowledge, navigate team dynamics, and understand professional etiquette.\nAn internship is more than just a line on your resume. It's a low-stakes opportunity to test-drive a career path, build a professional network, and develop skills that classrooms can't teachâ€”like client communication and project management. I urge every student, regardless of their field, to actively seek out internship opportunities. Start early, leverage the university's placement cell, and don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone. The lessons you learn will be invaluable.`

    content: `We didn't look the door\nwe just stopped returning.\nLeft coffee cups half-full\nand promises half-kept.\nThe light still poured in\nthrough the same crack in the ceiling,\nbut we no longer\nstood in it together.\nThe bed remembered us\ncreased sheets\nlike silent witnesses\nto where we once lay heart to heart,\nthen back to back,\nthen apart.\nThe walls held our laughter\na little too long,\nas if ecohoing might\nbring us back.\nBut love\nisn't a thing you forget\nit's a place you visit\nwith your eyes closed,\na scent that stops you in a crowd,\na song that opens the door\nyou thought you'd shut for good.`

    content: `Exam season is upon us, and the familiar scent of panic and instant noodles is in the air. But it doesn't have to be this way. Over my three years in the School of Design, I've honed a few strategies that have saved my grades and my sanity. First, ditch the all-nighters. Spaced repetition, using techniques like the Feynman method (teaching the concept to someone else), is far more effective for long-term retention.\nSecond, create a 'master document' for each subject, summarizing key concepts, formulas, and diagrams. This becomes your holy grail in the final days of revision. Lastly, prioritize your well-being. Get at least seven hours of sleep, stay hydrated, and schedule short breaks for exercise or hobbies. A burnt-out brain can't retain information, no matter how many hours you put in. Study smart, not just hard.`
