# Social Sharing Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED

### Problem

When sharing content on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp), the PPSU Chronicles logo was always displayed instead of the specific content image.

### Solution

Implemented dynamic Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata that uses the actual content image for each page.

## What Changed

### 1. **Stories** (`/stories/[slug]`)

- ✅ Added `generateMetadata()` function
- ✅ Story featured image now appears in social shares
- ✅ Updated ShareButtons to include title and description
- **Example:** Sharing "The Weight That Shapes Us" → Story's cover image appears

### 2. **Student Spotlights** (`/student-spotlights/[slug]`)

- ✅ Added `generateMetadata()` function
- ✅ Student photo now appears in social shares
- ✅ Added ShareButtons component with title and bio
- **Example:** Sharing Sartiah Karpeh's spotlight → Her photo appears

### 3. **Campus News** (`/campus-news/[slug]`)

- ✅ Updated ShareButtons to include news title and description
- **Example:** Sharing campus event → Event image appears (if available)

### 4. **Live Scores** (`/live`)

- ✅ Created layout with metadata
- ✅ Uses PPSU logo (correct - no specific match images)

### 5. **Homepage & General**

- ✅ Enhanced root layout metadata
- ✅ Uses PPSU logo as fallback (correct)

### 6. **ShareButtons Component**

- ✅ Now accepts `title` and `description` props
- ✅ Twitter shares include title
