# 🎯 Simple Camera Broadcasting Solution

## The Simple Fix

Instead of complex WebRTC/Livepeer, let's use a **simple approach**:

### Admin captures camera → Canvas → Firebase → Viewers display

This works immediately without any external services!

## Implementation

1. Admin camera captures frames
2. Draw to canvas every 100ms
3. Convert to data URL
4. Store in Firebase (or better: Firebase Realtime Database)
5. Viewers fetch and display

## Trade-offs

**Pros:**

- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No external services needed
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Good for 10-50 viewers

**Cons:**

- ⚠️ Lower quality than WebRTC
- ⚠️ ~1 second delay
- ⚠️ Firebase bandwidth usage
- ⚠️ Not ideal for 1000+ viewers

## For Production

Use Livepeer (takes 30 mins to set up):

1. Sign up: livepeer.studio
2. Get API key
3. Update AdminLiveStream to push RTMP
4. Update LiveVideoPlayer to pull HLS
5. Done!
